## [50 points] Questions

### [10 points] Step 1: Choose your configurations

1. What are the configurations you are going to run?

### [20 points] Step 2: Run your experiments

1. What is the speedup of each configuration over the "little" core? Present your results in a table as described in the assignment.

### [20 point] Step 3: Analyze your results and answer the research question

1. What is the biggest bottleneck in the performance of the original processor? The width, the number of physical registers, or the reorder buffer size? Use your data to support your answer.
